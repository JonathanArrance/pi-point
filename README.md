# Pi-Point

A Pi Zero W based wireless access point. The Pi can be plugged into AC power, or a battery pack makeing it an ideal for use on the move.

# Build

The Pi-Point is very easy to put together and setup. If you have ever done any other single board hobby project, you most likely have all of the parts alreayd. If not they can be obtained at a very reasonable cost. 

## Requierments

1. **Raspberry Pi Zero W**

The Raspberry Pi zero is a very small single board computer that can be used for prototypeing and hobby projects. The board has all of the same capabilities as the original Pi Zero, however, it also incorporates 802.11 a/b/n. This project requiers the wireless capabilities of the Pi Zero W, so a standard Pi Zero will not work.

2. **Micro SD Card**

The Pi Zero W uses a micro SD card to boot from. This is not going to be a high performance application, so any MicroSD card can be used. I would recommend an 8GB card at minimum. If you want to future proof for any other Pi Zero projects you may as well pick up a 16GB card. It is about the same price and you get the 2x the storage. To keep costs low get the most cost effective card you can find.

3. **Power Supply**

The Pi Zero W uses a mini usb power connector so any power 5 volt supply with a min USB style connector can be used. I would recommend getting one that is in your budget, you do not need to go overboard and get anything to expensive. If you have an available USB port, you can use a mini usb cable and power the the Pi Zero W up with a standard USB port.

4. **Battery Pack**

For a portable solution that you can take anywhere, you will need to get a battery pack of some sort that can output 5v DC. You can make one yourself or buy one. They are readily available, and if you have one for chargeing your phone on the go, you can most likely use that. See the link below for an example.

5. **Pi Zero Case**

The Pi Zero is a small board, and can fit in the palm of your hand. Its size makes it ideal for small IoT projects and hobbies, but the flip side of the coin is its durability. The Pi Zero is delicate and can be easily damaged. The case style is not important. Just get one that works well for you.
