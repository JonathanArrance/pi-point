# Pi-Point

A Pi Zero W based wireless access point. The Pi can be plugged into AC power, or a battery pack makeing it an ideal for use on the move.

# Build

The Pi-Point is very easy to put together and setup. If you have ever done any other single board hobby project, you most likely have all of the parts alreayd. If not they can be obtained at a very reasonable cost. 

## Requierments

1. **Raspberry Pi Zero W**

The Raspberry Pi zero is a very small single board computer that can be used for prototypeing and hobby projects. The board has all of the same capabilities as the original Pi Zero, however, it also incorporates 802.11 a/b/n. This project requiers the wireless capabilities of the Pi Zero W, so a standard Pi Zero will not work.
